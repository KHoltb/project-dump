  The beginning of my progress towards my goals. Currently a freshman in University of Saskatchewan where I plan to create and develop    projects during my freetime and so I have made this profile in the hopes of doing so. I'm hoping this will go far and I will be able to withstand most of my classes in relation to my learning of new code and its uses in the real world.
